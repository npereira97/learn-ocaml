<h2>Demo Exercise: Working with Lists</h2>

<p>
  This exercise serves as a demo of the style checker functionality we have implemented as an extension to Learn-OCaml. The template on the left contains examples of common style mistakes we have seen students make in their code due to misunderstandings about the code constructs in question.
</p>

<p>
  The style checker provides two categories of feedback: <em>warnings</em> and <em>suggestions</em>. Warnings are what we feel should always be taken into account, while a student may or may not want to apply a suggestion depending on concerns such as code readability.
</p>

<p>
  Since this exercise is only meant as a demo for the style checker, the questions in this exercise are not graded for correctness.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write a function <code>member: 'a -> 'a list -> bool</code> which checks if an element exists in a list.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Write a function <code>length: 'a list -> int</code> which returns the length of a list.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Write a function <code>filter: ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list</code> which returns all the elements of a list satisfying a given predicate. The order of the elements in the list should be preserved.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>Write a function <code>num_multiples: int -> int list -> int</code> such that <code>num_multiples x l</code> returns the number of elements in <code>l</code> that are evenly divisible by <code>x</code>. Use <code>length</code>, <code>filter</code>, and <code>divides</code> (as given to you in the prelude) in your answer.
  </li>
</ol>
